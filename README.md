# E-commerce-Customer-Analysis---Linear-Regression-Model
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict annual customer spending based on features like time on app/website, income, and membership length. Key insights show mobile app usage and membership duration strongly influence spending, helping optimize marketing strategies.

Project Overview
In this project, we suppose that the company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We are here to help them make a data-driven decision.


Dataset Overview
Avg. Session Length: The average time (in minutes) a customer spends per session.
Time on App: The total time (in minutes) a customer spends using the mobile application before making a purchase.
Time on Website: The total time (in minutes) a customer spends browsing the website before making a purchase.
Length of Membership: The duration of the customer’s membership in the store.
Yearly Amount Spent: The total amount spent by the customer on the platform.
